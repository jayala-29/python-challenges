# function descriptor: advCalc1()
# advanced calculator that supports addition and subtraction
# note: input from user does NOT use spaces
#       part 1 of building PEMDAS-based calculator
#       this represents parsing an expression as an algorithm
#       for addition and subtraction, we go "left to right"
#       the example for should be parsed as follows:
#           3+7-4+1  <-input
#           10-4+1
#           6+1
#           7        <- output
# return type: nothing; program should end when the user types 'n'
# example: Please enter an expression to calculate: '3+7-4+1'
#          Okay, the output is 7
#          Do you want to calculate anything else? [y|n] 'n'
#          Okay, bye bye :)
