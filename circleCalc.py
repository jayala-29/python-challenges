# function descriptor: circleCalc(r)
# calculates circle measures
# return type: nothing; program should end when the user types 'n'
# example: Today we will be finding the different measures a circle gives us.
#          What would you like the radius to be? '2'
#          The radius of the circle you chose is 2.
#          What would you like to calculate? [area|circumference] 'area'
#          Okay, the area is ___
#          Do you want to calculate anything else? [y|n] 'y'
#          What would you like to calculate? [area|circumference] 'circumference'
#          Okay, the circumference is ___
#          Do you want to calculate anything else? [y|n] 'n'
#          Okay, bye bye :)
